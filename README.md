### Building
You'll need to get familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) as well as [How to build a GSI](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F).

Create a new working directory for your VoltageOS build and navigate to it:
    ```
    mkdir voltage; cd voltage
    ```
- Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kelexine/treble_voltage -b 14
    ```
- Finally, start the build script:
    ```
    bash treble_voltage/build.sh
    ```
